# CodeBattles #
CodeBattle is (currently) a one-on-one coding challenge game. After signaling that both users are prepared, a prompt is distributed to each. The objective is to accurately complete the challenge described by a prompt's criteria before one's opponent does. Users are able to type and submit code whose output is compared against various test cases; each player codes as fast as they can until one of them successfully solves the problem.
